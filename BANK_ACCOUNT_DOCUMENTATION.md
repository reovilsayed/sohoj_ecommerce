### Custom Validation
Form validation can be extended in the resource form builder.

### Workflow Integration
Custom actions can be added for workflow integration (approval processes, verification, etc.).

## Best Practices

1. **Default Accounts**: Always ensure users have one default active account
2. **Security**: Never display full account numbers in listings
3. **Validation**: Validate routing numbers and account formats
4. **Status Management**: Use status changes instead of deletion when possible
5. **Audit Trail**: Consider adding audit logging for sensitive changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No Default Account**: System automatically sets first active account as default
- **Multiple Defaults**: Model boot method prevents this automatically
- **User Missing**: Ensure user exists before creating bank account
- **Migration Issues**: Run migrations in correct order (users first, then bank_accounts)

### Error Handling
- Validation messages for invalid inputs
- Notification system for successful operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Future Enhancements
- Bank account verification system
- Integration with payment gateways
